# Konfetti App

App to build better local communities.

This repo contains prototype v2 - in fresh development. You find prototype v1 here: https://github.com/rootzoll/konfetti-app

### Get it running locally for development

Start up development backend locally (see README): 
https://github.com/konfetti-app/konfetti-backend

We recommend using NVM to use a fresh NodeJS environment for app development:
https://github.com/creationix/nvm

```bash
$ nvm use
```
(if the displayed version is not install - install it )

And then start the Konfetti app in your browser: 

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic serve
```

Happy development ... more info soon.

### Managing Multi-Language Translation

The Konfetti app uses the ngx-translate framework as recommended by the IONIC project.
http://ionicframework.com/docs/developer-resources/ng2-translate/
https://github.com/ngx-translate/core

But instead of having single JSON files for the different languages, you just find one big file called 'i18n-data.json' 
in the 'assets/i18n' folder. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. The content of the file is an export of a Google Spreadsheet that 
the Konfetti project uses to collaborate with external translators.

You can find the Translation Spreadsheet here: 
[LINK TO BE ADDED LATER]

The export is managed with the following script:

### Joining Betatest with Ionic View

Short Video Tutorial (German): https://youtu.be/15ovpwUK81I

Go to https://view.ionic.io and install the Ionic View App for iOS or Android.

Start the Ionic View App. Use Search and enter the App ID `db5effdf`.

Then you should see the konfetti-app in your list and you can start it.
You see a "Shake device for Control Menu" screen. Thats not the konfetti app yet.
Thats the Ionic View App telling you how to open the control menu and exit the Konfetti app.
After a short while you should see the Welcome/Intro screen of the Konfetti app and you can start testing.

### Pushing out a new text version of Ionic View (Admin Note)

The local repo needs to be connected to the Ionic Pro Dashboard: https://dashboard.ionicjs.com 
If not already use `ionic link --pro-id db5effdf` (access to account is needed).
To push a new version to the Ionic View app Testers  `git push ionic master`.
Go to the Ionic Pro Dashboard. Under 'Code/Builds' the new commit should show up and offer after some time the 'deploy' option.
When deployed the tag 'Master' should be visible on that commit and it should ne be available to Testers with the Ionic View App.
