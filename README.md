# Konfetti App

App to build better local communities.

This repo contains prototype v2 - in fresh development. You find prototype v1 here: https://github.com/rootzoll/konfetti-app

### Get it running locally for development

 Start up development backend locally (see README): 
https://github.com/konfetti-app/konfetti-backend

We recommend using NVM to use a fresh NodeJS environment for app development:
https://github.com/creationix/nvm

```bash
$ nvm use
```
(if the displayed version is not install - install it )

And then start the Konfetti app in your browser: 

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic serve
```

Happy development ... more info soon.
