# Konfetti App

App to build better local communities.

* You find prototype v1 here: https://github.com/rootzoll/konfetti-app
* This repo contains prototype v2 - with a big UX redesign.
* During the summer of 2019 we will build a prototype v3.

### Get it running locally for development

Start up development backend locally (see README): 
https://github.com/konfetti-app/konfetti-backend

We recommend using NVM to use a fresh NodeJS environment for app development:
https://github.com/creationix/nvm

```bash
$ nvm use
```
(if the displayed version is not install - install it )

And then start the Konfetti app in your browser: 

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
$ ionic serve
```

Happy development ... more info soon.

### Managing Multi-Language Translation

The Konfetti app uses the ngx-translate framework as recommended by the IONIC project.
http://ionicframework.com/docs/developer-resources/ng2-translate/
https://github.com/ngx-translate/core

But instead of having single JSON files for the different languages, you just find one big file called 'i18n-data.json' 
in the 'assets/i18n' folder. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE. The content of the file is an export of a Google Spreadsheet that 
the Konfetti project uses to collaborate with external translators.

The export to that JSON file is managed with the following script from a sheet with:
